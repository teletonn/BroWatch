    // a result: the card is on 18/19/23, and the display's SPI engine never
    // clocked those pins. Its display now runs on HSPI -- see its user setup
    // -- so it takes the original board's branch below with a bus of its own.)
    // The RL Phantom landed here for the same reason cyd35 does, and it cost a
    // tester an evening: its resistive touch chip sits on the DISPLAY's bus, so
    // the extra pins this attaches corrupt MISO for every touch read afterwards.
    // The symptom is precise and was reported exactly as described below --
    // the 4-corner calibration works (it runs BEFORE engine.init() brings SD up)
    // and touch is dead on the very next screen. Not a bad calibration blob: a
    // corrupted bus underneath a perfectly good one.
    //
    // SD.begin(csPin) defaults its SPIClass& parameter to the Arduino
    // *global* `SPI` object -- a separate, never-begun C++ instance
    // from TFT_eSPI's own internal one, even though both ultimately
    // target the same VSPI hardware. SDFS::begin() (ESP32 core's
    // SD.cpp) unconditionally calls that object's own spi.begin() with
    // NO arguments; for a never-begun SPIClass, SPIClass::begin() falls
    // back to the compiled-in esp32dev board defaults -- SCK=18,
    // MISO=19, MOSI=23 -- regardless of this board's real shared-bus
    // pins (14/13/12 here). Root-caused on real cyd35 hardware: those
    // extra pins get ADDITIONALLY attached to VSPI's signals via the
    // GPIO matrix (spiAttachSCK() etc. are additive, not exclusive),
    // corrupting MISO for every touch read afterward even though the
    // display's write-only path looked completely fine.
    //
    // Passing TFT_eSPI's own already-init()'d SPI instance instead
    // makes SDFS::begin()'s internal spi.begin() call a genuine no-op
    // (SPIClass::begin() returns immediately if already begun -- see
    // its own guard), so nothing extra ever gets attached to the bus.
    //
    // AWOK deliberately does NOT get this treatment despite sharing
    // the same VSPI-bus shape: real hardware regression testing showed
    // its touch stops responding once SD.begin() runs with the shared
    // instance passed in (SD.begin() still attempts real transactions
    // over that peripheral even though `begin()` itself becomes a
    // no-op, and AWOK's touch chip is apparently more sensitive to
    // that than cyd35's) -- so it keeps the plain no-args SD.begin()
